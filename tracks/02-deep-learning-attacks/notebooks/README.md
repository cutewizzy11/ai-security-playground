# Notebooks: Deep Learning Attacks

Suggested notebooks for contributors:

- `01-simple-fgsm-on-mnist.ipynb` – Train a small CNN and generate FGSM adversarial examples.
- `02-pgd-and-stronger-attacks.ipynb` – Explore stronger iterative attacks.
- `03-basic-defenses.ipynb` – Try simple defenses and measure robustness.

Feel free to add new notebooks with clear titles and explanations.
Keep models small and training time short so others can run them easily.
