# Style Guide (Short)

- Use clear, descriptive names for notebooks and scripts.
- Write code that is readable first, clever second.
- Prefer explanatory comments only where needed; keep notebooks clean.
- Use headings and short sections in notebooks to guide the reader.
- Keep outputs in notebooks to what is necessary for understanding.

Consistency helps newcomers learn faster.
