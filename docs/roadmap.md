# Roadmap

This is an informal roadmap for AI Security Playground.

## Short term

- Populate `tracks/00-intro-to-ai-security` with beginner-friendly notebooks.
- Finish at least one end-to-end mini-project (e.g., phishing email detector).
- Improve documentation and contribution guidelines.

## Medium term

- Add tracks for classical ML security, deep learning attacks, and LLM security.
- Introduce more advanced projects (adversarial attacks, anomaly detection, etc.).
- Add basic automated checks (formatting, tests) on pull requests.

## Long term

- Host a rich library of AI security examples across difficulty levels.
- Encourage research-oriented contributions and experiment reproductions.
- Build a vibrant community of contributors and learners.
