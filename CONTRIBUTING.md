# Contributing to AI Security Playground

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

This project welcomes contributions from **beginners**, **intermediate**, and **advanced** practitioners in AI and security.

## Ways to contribute

- Improve or add notebooks in `tracks/`
- Add or extend mini-projects in `projects/`
- Improve documentation in `docs/`
- Fix bugs, refactor code, or improve tests

## Getting started

1. **Fork** the repository and **clone** your fork.
2. Create a Python virtual environment.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Create a new branch for your change.

## Picking an issue

- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` if you are new.
- Issues may also be labeled by difficulty: `beginner`, `intermediate`, `advanced`.
- Topic labels include `cybersecurity`, `adversarial-ml`, `llm-security`, `docs`, and more.

If you want to propose a new idea:
- Open an issue with the **New project / track proposal** template.

## Code and notebook guidelines

- Use **Python 3.10+**.
- Prefer the libraries already in `requirements.txt` when possible.
- Keep notebooks reasonably small and focused. Avoid committing very large outputs.
- Place new content in the appropriate folder:
  - Learning material → `tracks/<track-name>/`
  - Mini-project → `projects/<project-name>/`

## Style and quality

- Follow standard Python style (PEP 8). Using tools like `black` and `isort` is recommended.
- Add or update tests for non-trivial Python modules where appropriate.
- Update relevant `README.md` files to briefly document your contribution.

## Pull request process

1. Ensure your branch is up to date with the default branch.
2. Run tests or key notebooks that your change affects.
3. Open a Pull Request using the template.
4. Address review comments if maintainers request changes.

Your contributions help the community learn and push AI security forward. Thank you!
