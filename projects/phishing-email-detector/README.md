# Project: Phishing Email Detector

A beginner-to-intermediate project to build a simple phishing email detector using classical machine learning.

## Idea

Use a public dataset of emails (or text samples) to train a model that classifies messages as phishing or legitimate.

## Suggested steps

1. Load and explore the dataset.
2. Clean and preprocess text (tokenization, basic features, etc.).
3. Train baseline models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest).
4. Evaluate performance and discuss limitations.

## Contributions

- Provide a clean notebook implementing the steps above.
- Add scripts in `src/` for data preprocessing or training.
- Improve documentation and visualizations.

Please keep the dataset small or provide a download script / link rather than committing large raw data.
