# Notebooks: Adversarial Images

Possible starter notebooks:

- `01-train-simple-cnn.ipynb` – Train a small CNN on a toy image dataset.
- `02-fgsm-attack.ipynb` – Implement and visualize FGSM adversarial examples.
- `03-pgd-attack.ipynb` – Implement a stronger iterative attack.

You can add more notebooks as the project grows. Aim for short, focused experiments that others can run on a CPU in a reasonable time.
